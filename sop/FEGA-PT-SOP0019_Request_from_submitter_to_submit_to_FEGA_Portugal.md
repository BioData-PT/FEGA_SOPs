### Purpose

Provide the full set of instructions and support to allow the user to
start the data and metadata upload process into the FEGA node.

### Scope

This SOP must be used to create a metadata-only submission account at
CEGA for data submission to the FEGA Portugal node upon the completion
of the FEGA nodes’ Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with the submitter.
This SOP details how to use the Helpdesk to open the submission account
for the submission of the metadata to CEGA.

    to submit to FEGA.

    role to the user account by using the FEGA helpdesk portal. (SOP:
