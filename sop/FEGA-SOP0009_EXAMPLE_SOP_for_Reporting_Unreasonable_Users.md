Purpose

EGA Helpdesk answers thousands of tickets, and despite best efforts,
users may become agitated and use language that could be considered too
direct or offensive. The purpose of this SOP is to assist Helpdesk
officers in highlighting potentially abusive behaviour to EGA management
in order to seek both support and advice.

Scope

This SOP details the protocol to be followed if a user is considered to
be abusive/too direct to EGA Helpdesk staff.

Procedure

1.  Upon receipt of a message which you deem unreasonable, abusive, or
    overly direct, intimidates or harasses you, or makes you feel
    uncomfortable, flag it to the Helpdesk Team Leads.

2.  If the ticket is deemed to be unreasonable by Helpdesk Team Leads,
    forward it to the appropriate internal emailing list (or your line
    manager directly if you prefer) giving a brief history of the ticket
    and why you feel it is unacceptable. Provide the RT ticket number so
    that EGA management are aware of the situation.

    1.  If you feel uncomfortable dealing with the ticket, pass the
        ticket to a Helpdesk Team Lead.

3.  In collaboration with Helpdesk Team Lead(s), make sure that the
    ticket is dealt with prioritised above other tickets and deal with
    it efficiently, making sure it is appropriately tagged, commented
    and reminders set.

4.  If the user continues to behave unreasonably, advise them that the
    ticket will be escalated to EGA management. Flag the ticket again to
    the appropriate email list (or your line manager) and ask for advice
    from the EGA management on how to deal with the ticket.
