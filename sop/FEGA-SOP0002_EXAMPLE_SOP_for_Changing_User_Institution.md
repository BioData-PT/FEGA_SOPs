Purpose

<span class="mark">A user may contact the EGA Helpdesk requesting to
change their details (username or address), which may indicate an
organisational/institutional change or you may notice that the user has
supplied an address or is using an email address that is not consistent
with the details provided by the relevant Data Access Committee/s
(DACs).</span>

Scope

In the case of institutional changes, EGA protocols require the end-user
to contact the relevant Data Access Committee (DAC) to update them of
any changes. In order to change user details within the EGA system such
as affiliation, changes must be confirmed with the relevant DAC to
ensure that data access agreements remain valid. During the period of
re-authorization, users may not be able to access EGA datasets until
appropriate approval has been received from the DAC. The SOP details the
steps to be undertaken by the Helpdesk officer to respond to the change
request and mediate the communication with the DAC as required.

Procedure

1.  Notify the user that they need to contact the relevant DAC(s) to
    inform them of the changes to their details and inform the user that
    their account will be placed 'on hold' until notification from the
    DAC that details have been updated.

2.  Place the user’s account on hold by blocking the account (under user
    account) and 'Add user log' to document your action.

3.  Re-active the user’s account only upon direct instruction from the
    DAC(s).

4.  Inform the user of the DAC(s) access decision via RT ticketing
    system.
