**Purpose**

The purpose of this SOP is to establish a standardised process for
validating a submission within the Federated EGA Helpdesk. The SOP
outlines the necessary steps and guidelines to ensure that all submitted
data and accompanying documentation are thoroughly reviewed, verified,
and validated in a consistent and efficient manner.

By implementing this SOP, several valuable outcomes can be achieved.
Firstly, it promotes quality assurance by ensuring that all submissions
undergo a rigorous validation process. This helps to maintain the
integrity, accuracy, and reliability of the data and associated
information within the Federated EGA Helpdesk system. Secondly, the SOP
fosters transparency and accountability by providing a clear set of
guidelines that all team members can follow uniformly, thus reducing
potential errors, inconsistencies, and delays.

**Scope**

This SOP indicates the steps to follow in order to validate a FEGA
submission once the user has finalised it through the FEGA Submitter
