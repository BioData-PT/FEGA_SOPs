## Purpose

FEGA Portugal Helpdesk provides assistance to its users. Through the course of a year, FEGA Portugal Helpdesk responds to tickets across a wide variety of issues. The purpose of this SOP is to ensure that all Helpdesk staff can manage their ticket load in a time efficient manner. Our goal is to provide a response within 48 working hours of each user reply and to ensure that no users' communications are missed.

## Scope

This SOP should be followed by all FEGA Portugal Helpdesk staff at all times when taking and dealing with Helpdesk tickets and should be read in conjunction with the SOP for [Helpdesk Ticket Assignment](./FEGA-PT-SOP0003_Helpdesk_Ticket_Assignment.md).

## Procedure

1. Make sure you set up your ticketing system so you can instantly see tickets that are awaiting a reply when you log into the system.

2. Get into good habits of answering those tickets awaiting a reply first thing in the morning (or as soon as you start working on Helpdesk).

3. Only take tickets when you have answered all of your existing tickets.

4. If you are struggling to keep on top of your tickets, **ask for help**.

5. Where tickets are waiting on development work, make sure that you try to update the user every 48 hours and manage their expectations accordingly (make sure that these tickets are cross referenced clearly with the corresponding issue tracker ticket(s)).

6. Resolve any tickets that you believe can be resolved when it is 48 hours since the last correspondence from the user.

7. When you know you have a significant amount of annual leave coming up (i.e. one week or more), refrain from taking new tickets the week before (if possible) and resolve down as many of the existing ones as you can, letting the user know that you are going on annual leave and that if they need further assistance they should create a new ticket.

8. The day before you go on leave make sure all of your remaining tickets are fully commented so other Helpdesk officers can see what needs to be done. In addition, tag any tickets remaining with "holiday priority". By using this tag, other Helpdesk officers can see any of your tickets that may need addressing instantly by running a simple query.

9. In exceptional cases, you may be working on a ticket that will be open for a long time. In this instance tag them with the "long running" custom tag in combination with any other appropriate tags, e.g. "large submission". After each communication with the user, make sure reminders are updated and new dates are set so that you are sure to follow up with them.
