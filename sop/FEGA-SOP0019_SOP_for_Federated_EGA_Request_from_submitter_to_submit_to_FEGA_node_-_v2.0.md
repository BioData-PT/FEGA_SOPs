### Purpose

Provide the full set of instructions and support to allow the user to
start the data and metadata upload process into the FEGA node.

### Scope

This SOP must be used to create a metadata-only submission account at
CEGA for data submission to the FEGA Portugal node upon the completion
of the FEGA nodesâ€™ Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with the submitter.
This SOP details how to use the Helpdesk to open the submission account
for the submission of the metadata to CEGA.

### Procedure

1.  Submitter contacts the FEGA helpdesk requesting
    to submit to FEGA.

2.  Submitter obtains information from the FEGA
    Portugal node that is required for submission.
