Purpose

EGA Helpdesk provides support to its users by using the Request Tracker
(RT) system. Through the course of a year, Helpdesk responds to
thousands of tickets across a wide variety of issues. The purpose of
this SOP is to ensure that all Helpdesk staff act in a consistent
manner, and more importantly that each user has the same experience.

Scope

This SOP should be followed by all Helpdesk staff at all times when
taking and dealing with Helpdesk tickets and should be read in
conjunction with the SOP for [<u>Managing EGA Helpdesk
Tickets</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VzGptBRE2vrhQFfhJHKEgC1Qcnv5jvk7nx4PyMZiFPI/edit?usp=sharing).

Procedure

1.  **<u>Always</u>** take the next ticket in the queue (unless it is
    specifically addressed to someone in which case let that HD
    individual know (if they are on annual/sick leave then take the
    ticket and answer if you can).

2.  Read the ticket carefully and then follow the appropriate SOP
    depending on the issue.

3.  Reply to the ticket wherever possible using an appropriate RT
    article. Once you have replied to the ticket make sure that you:

    1.  Apply the appropriate custom tag (if unsure ask)

    2.  Add the amount of time spent

    3.  Set the status tag of the ticket to say if it is waiting on user
        or helpdesk action

    4.  **ALWAYS** set an appropriate reminder (this helps not only you,
        but also another HD should they have to pick up your ticket)

4.  If you still do not know how to answer the ticket, **ask for help**
    (it is the only way to learn).

    1.  In the first instance, you can message the \#helpdesk channel in
        the EGA Slack Workspace.

    2.  If there is no answer on Slack, you can contact the EGA Helpdesk
        Team Lead(s).

5.  Considerations:

    1.  **<u>Do not phone a user unless they specifically request you to
        do so, or offer for the user to ring you, except in exceptional
        circumstances</u>**. Exceptional circumstances are considered to
        be vocal complaints, issues arising from grant funded work or
        security issues. **<u>If you are unsure if you should make or
        take a call, ask for advice (see point 2 above)</u>**. If you
        make or take a call make sure you take full notes of the
        conversation and then reply to the RT thread stating clearly
        what has been agreed. This then gives the user the opportunity
        to see if you and they have understood the conversation
        correctly.

    2.  If something is “not working” at EGA, do not state this in the
        correspondence, as this is bad practice and makes us look very
        unprofessional. Acknowledge the users issue and say that you
        will investigate accordingly or escalate to an engineer.

    3.  Refrain from going into too much detail in tickets. Answer the
        users query succinctly - they do not need to know about EGA’s
        system and processes. Where possible always use an RT article.

    4.  **If you are ever unsure of anything please always ask for
        help**. Do not make a guess at the answer as this may lead the
        user in the wrong direction and waste both their time and yours.
