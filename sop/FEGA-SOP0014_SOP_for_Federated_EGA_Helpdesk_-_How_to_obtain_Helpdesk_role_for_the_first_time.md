**Purpose**

If a FEGA node is interested in using the FEG Helpdesk Portal you can
learn how to do it with this SOP. Being a FEGA Helpdesk and having
access to the FEGA Helpdesk Portal will allow you to set the submitter
role and allow their submitters to use the Submitter Portal and start
depositing data, check the summary of completed FEGA submissions, as
well as the possibility to release FEGA datasets to CEGA website for
discoverability.

**Scope**

You can learn the necessary steps to gain access to the Helpdesk Portal
of your Federated node for the first time.

**Procedure**

1.  *Register yourself as an EGA user by populating the [<u>registration
    form</u>](https://the.test.ega-archive.org/register/).*

2.  *CEGA Helpdesk will have to verify your account. Once it has been
    verified by CEGA Helpdesk you can proceed with step 3.*

3.  *When you want to gain access to the FEGA Helpdesk Portal contact
    the CEGA Helpdesk by sending an email to
    [<u>fega-helpdesk@ega-archive.org</u>](mailto:fega-helpdesk@ega-archive.org)*

4.  *CEGA Helpdesk will verify that the request comes from an official
    FEGA partner*

5.  *Once the role has been verified the new FEGA Helpdesk member will
    receive a notification and will be able to log in to their specific
    FEGA Helpdesk Portal:*

    1.  *helpdesk.{fega}.ega.archive.org*

6.  *From here on the FEGA node has access to their Helpdesk Portal and
    can assign roles to their FEGA services (submitters and new helpdesk
    officers).*
