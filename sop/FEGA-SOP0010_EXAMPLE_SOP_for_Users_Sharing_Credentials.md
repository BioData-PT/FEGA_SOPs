Purpose

EGA services are strictly reserved for those that hold an EGA account as
detailed
[<u>here</u>](https://ega-archive.org/download/using_ega_account). This
is to ensure that only authorised users can access and download data for
which access has been granted by the appropriate Data Access Committee
(DAC). Adhering to this SOP will mitigate the risk of data breaches
caused by unauthorised data access.

Scope

This SOP details the procedure to follow if the Helpdesk members find
cases of a user sharing credentials in order to use EGA download
services. EGA accounts are assigned on an individual basis for the
exclusive use of the authorised EGA account holder. Log-in details must
remain private and only be used by the EGA account holder.

Procedure

There are known cases of users sharing their data access credentials in
order to use EGA services to download data. In some cases, EGA knows
which authorised user account has been shared. For example, the user
states in the ticket that they are using someone else’s account and
provides the account name. In other cases, EGA knows that an account has
been shared but doesn’t know which account it is. For example, a user
generally states they are using someone else’s account but doesn’t
provide the account name. These two scenarios are dealt with using the
following procedures:

**<u>Users using credentials where authorised user is unknown</u>**

1.  Helpdesk officer suspects that a user is using another authorised
    user’s credentials, but cannot confirm which authorised user’s
    account is being used. For example, the user says they are
    “downloading on behalf of a colleague” a log file is supplied which
    doesn’t contain the authorised user’s account information.

2.  Helpdesk officer requests that the user provide the details of the
    authorised account they are using. Helpdesk officer should refrain
    from offering further assistance until the authorised account is
    confirmed.

3.  If the authorised account details match the original user, the
    Helpdesk officer proceeds with assistance following standard EGA
    protocols.

4.  If the authorised account details do not match the original user,
    the Helpdesk officer follows the procedure described in the “Users
    sharing credentials where authorised user is known” section.

**<u>Users sharing credentials where authorised user is known</u>**

1.  Helpdesk officer identifies and confirms that a user is using
    another authorised user's credentials. For example, the Helpdesk
    officer is provided a screenshot of the user’s commands or a log
    file and can identify the account (email address) being used is
    different from the user’s email address on the Helpdesk ticket.

2.  Helpdesk officer adds the authorised user to the RT ticket and the
    corresponding DAC, and replies to the original user using RT
    **Article XXX**, and temporarily blocks the authorised user account
    pending response from the DAC.

3.  If the DAC responds with approval for the original user, the
    Helpdesk offer will:

    1.  Change password on authorised account and send to authorised
        user (so the original user doesn’t have access to the account
        anymore).

    2.  Create a new authorised account for the original user (based on
        approval of DAC).

    3.  Ask the original user to use their own account now, and if they
        continue to have issues to contact HD again.

<!-- -->

1.  If the DAC responds and doesn’t approve the original user:

    1.  Change password on authorised account and send to authorised
        user (so the original user doesn’t have access to the account
        anymore).

    2.  Inform the original user that they have not been authorised to
        access the data.
