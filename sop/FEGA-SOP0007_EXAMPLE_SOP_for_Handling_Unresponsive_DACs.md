Purpose

The EGA has more than 1,000 Data Access Committees (DACs). Over time it
is inevitable that some DACs may become “unresponsive”, meaning that a
DAC fails to communicate with a requestor within a reasonable time
frame - usually two weeks. There are caveats to the two week time frame,
for example during the months of July, August, and December when DAC
members may be on leave. In such cases, we should make allowance for a
delayed response. Where we deem a DAC to be unresponsive, EGA should be
as proactive as possible in order to try and locate and communicate with
the “unresponsive DAC”.

Scope

This SOP describes the steps that the Helpdesk team should take in order
to work with unresponsive DACs.

Procedure

1.  On receipt of a requestor claiming that a DAC is being unresponsive,
    check when they last emailed the DAC. If they state it was less than
    two weeks ago, inform them it is our policy in the first instance to
    allow the DAC two weeks to reply.

2.  Once the two week grace period has lapsed, the following steps
    should be taken:

    1.  Identify all members of the unresponsive DAC using the following
        query  
          
        *\<Provide internal query or method for querying to find members
        of the unresponsive DAC\>*

    2.  Once you have the email addresses of the DAC members, first
        check for activity within RT to see when the DAC members last
        emailed in.

        1.  If you can see that they are active, you can reply to a
            thread and ask about a user’s request to check that they
            have received it.

        2.  If you cannot see any signs of activity, send an email
            through RT using **Article 855** to all of the DAC contacts
            and all of the Submission contacts, making sure that all of
            the contacts are set as “requestors”. **<u>Set a
            reminder</u>** to follow up with them again in 2 weeks if
            you have not heard from them. Also suggest to the requestor
            that they send another email to the DAC at this time point

3.  If there is no response after 4 weeks since the initial request
    (meaning, at least two follow-ups through RT), email
    [<u>ega_dac_response@ebi.ac.uk</u>](mailto:ega_dac_response@ebi.ac.uk)
    to make them aware of the situation and point to all relevant
    correspondence, including the RT ticket number. After agreement from
    them, follow up with **Article** **877**. Email the user to which
    the DAC was unresponsive and update them on progress so far, and be
    sure to ask if they have heard anything from the DAC.

4.  If there is no response after 6 weeks since the initial request, use
    RT **Article 856**, set a reminder to follow-up, and update the
    requestor.

5.  If there is no response after 8 weeks since the initial request,
    contact the authorised submitter(s) and their institution,
    organisation, or department (usually this will be a generic email
    address) and ask for the DAC responsibility to be reassigned. Use RT
    **Article 995**, set a reminder to follow up the ticket, and update
    the requestor.

6.  If there is no response after 10 weeks since the initial request,
    email the legal department (or representative) and DPO of the
    submitter’s organisation and use the following RT **Article 996**,
    set a reminder to follow up the ticket, and update the requestor.
    Also, email
    [<u>ega_dac_response@ebi.ac.uk</u>](mailto:ega_dac_response@ebi.ac.uk)
    informing them that an email to the institutional legal department
    has been sent?

7.  If there is not response after 12 weeks since the initial request.
    Email
    [<u>ega_dac_response@ebi.ac.uk</u>](mailto:ega_dac_response@ebi.ac.uk)
    informing about the completion of the SOP, and withdraw the dataset
    following the appropriate SOP. Inform the initial requester, DAC,
    submitter, institution and/or legal department indicating that the
    dataset has been withdrawn. If the dataset or study are referenced
    in a published paper, email the journal and inform the data is no
    longer available.

### Article 855

Dear ,

It has been brought to our attention that on (date) a user has made an
attempt to contact you regarding an application to access the dataset(s)
that fall under the governance of your DAC:

(dataset accession links)

Unfortunately, to date, the user states that they have not yet had a
response regarding their inquiry.

Can we confirm you have received such a request, and if so have you
responded to the request?

If you have not yet responded to the original request, can we ask that
you do so at your earliest convenience?

I would appreciate it if you could acknowledge receipt of this email and
should you need any assistance with this process please don't hesitate
to ask.

Thank you.

Kind regards,

### Article 877

Dear ,

Further to my email dated (date), regarding your non-response to a user
regarding an application to access the dataset/s that fall under the
governance of you DAC:

(dataset accessions)

We have yet to have a response for you and would like to again inquire
if there is anything we can do to assist you in your role as DAC
contact.

Apologies if the role of the DAC has not been clearly defined at the
point of your submission. Please see the link below for the roles and
responsibility of a DAC:
[<u>https://ega-archive.org/submission/data_access_committee</u>](https://ega-archive.org/submission/data_access_committee)

I have set another reminder on this ticket for two weeks time, and will
contact you again to see if I can be of any further assistance.

Kind regards,

### Article 856

Dear ,

It has been brought to our attention that a user has made an attempt to
contact you regarding an application to access the dataset(s) that fall
under the governance of your DAC:

(dataset accession links)

Can I remind you that you are a contact for (Insert DAC accession), the
entity responsible for governing access to the dataset(s) submitted to
the EGA.

The roles and responsibility of a DAC are defined here:

[<u>https://ega-archive.org/submission/data_access_committee</u>](https://ega-archive.org/submission/data_access_committee)

Please be advised, that continued failure to respond to applications may
be escalated to the Journal where your study is published (insert PubMed
ID), since the data is effectively unavailable, and may also result in
the study being removed from the EGA website.

I have set a reminder on this ticket for two weeks' time. If no response
is registered, the EGA will consider proceeding with the above measures.

Kind regards,

### Article 995

Dear ,

It has been brought to our attention that a user has made an attempt to
contact the DAC you assigned for your dataset \<EGADXXX\>.

\<Add DAC link\>

After several failed attempts to contact the DAC, we are contacting you
to ask you to reassign the responsibility of the DAC, and add a new
contact for the DAC that will manage the data access requests.

To add a new contact of the DAC, please send us the name, Institution
name, and institutional email and we will add them for you.

Please be advised, that continued failure to respond to applications may
be escalated to the Journal where your study is published \<insert
PubMed ID\>, since the data is effectively unavailable, and may also
result in the study being removed from the EGA website.

I have set a reminder on this ticket for two weeks' time. If no response
is registered, the EGA will proceed with the above measures.

Kind regards,

### Article 996

Dear ,

We are contacting you from the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA). We
are a service for permanent archiving and sharing of all types of
personally identifiable genetic and phenotypic data resulting from
biomedical research projects.

Some time ago, we archived data generated by individuals employed by
your Institution after entering into a Data Processing Agreement which
names EGA as a Data Processor and your Institution as the Data
Controller. Additionally, the submitting individuals created a Data
Access Committee (DAC) whose members are responsible for reviewing and
approving access requests for the data at the EGA. All data stored at
EGA is controlled access data, and all data access requests must be
reviewed and approved by the DAC before EGA can share it.

For 10 weeks we have tried and failed to make contact with the DAC
members and the submitters requesting that they respond to data access
requests, effectively resulting in the archived data being unavailable
for sharing. As you can appreciate, this is a major concern as the data
have been published and are meant to be available to share \<PubMedID\>.

Below you can find the information of the unresponsive DAC and the
individuals who initially submitted the dataset.

\<Add contact information DAC\>

\<Add contact information submitter\>

\<Add DAC link\>

\<Add dataset link\>

After several failed attempts to contact them, we are contacting you to
request that you reassign the responsibility of the DAC to at least one
individual from your Institution who has the authority to review and
approve data access requests.

To reassign the contact of the DAC, please send us the name, Institution
name, and institutional email and we will add them for you.

Please be advised that continued failure to respond to applications may
result in the study being removed from the EGA website. Additional
measures may be implemented, including escalation to the Journal where
the EGA study is published \<insert PubMed ID\>.

I have set a reminder on this ticket for two weeks' time. If no response
is registered, the EGA will consider proceeding with the above measures.

Kind regards,
