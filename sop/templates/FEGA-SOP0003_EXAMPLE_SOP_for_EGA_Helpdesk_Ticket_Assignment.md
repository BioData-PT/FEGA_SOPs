## Purpose

EGA Helpdesk provides support to its users by using the Request Tracker (RT) system. The purpose of this SOP is to ensure that all Helpdesk staff act in a consistent manner, and more importantly that each user has the same experience.

## Scope

This SOP should be followed by all Helpdesk staff at all times when taking and dealing with Helpdesk tickets and should be read in conjunction with the SOP for [Managing EGA Helpdesk Tickets](./FEGA-SOP0004_EXAMPLE_SOP_for_EGA_Helpdesk_Ticket_Management.md).

## Procedure

- Pre-requisites. Get familiar with the [Request Tracker Interface Manual](https://rt-wiki.bestpractical.com/wiki/ManualUsingWebInterface) and in case of doubt, ask your supervisor.

1. **Always** take the next ticket in the queue, unless it is specifically addressed to someone in which case let that helpdesker (HD) know (if they are on annual/sick leave then take the ticket and answer if you can).

2. Read the ticket carefully and then follow the appropriate SOP depending on the issue.

3. Reply to the ticket wherever possible using an appropriate RT article. Once you have replied to the ticket make sure that you:

   1. Apply the appropriate custom tag
   2. Add the amount of time spent
   3. Set the status tag of the ticket to say if it is waiting on user or helpdesk action
   4. **ALWAYS** set an appropriate reminder (this helps not only you, but also another HD should they have to pick up your ticket)

4. Considerations:

   1. **Do not phone a user unless they specifically request you to do so, or offer for the user to ring you, except in exceptional circumstances**. Exceptional circumstances are considered to be vocal complaints, issues arising from grant funded work or security issues. **If you are unsure if you should make or take a call, ask for advice**. If you make or take a call make sure you take full notes of the conversation and then reply to the RT thread stating clearly what has been agreed. This then gives the user the opportunity to see if you and they have understood the conversation correctly.

   2. If something is "not working" at EGA, do not state this in the correspondence, as this is bad practice and makes us look very unprofessional. Acknowledge the users issue and say that you will investigate accordingly or escalate to an engineer.

   3. Refrain from going into too much detail in tickets. Answer the users query succinctly - they do not need to know about EGA's system and processes. Where possible always use an RT article.

   4. **If you are ever unsure of anything please always ask for help**. Do not make a guess at the answer as this may lead the user in the wrong direction and waste both their time and yours.
