## Purpose

This SOP describes how a FEGA Helpdesk officer can grant the submitter
role to a FEGA user via the Helpdesk Portal. This allows the user to
access the Submitter Portal for their node. If you don’t know how to get
access to your FEGA Helpdesk node for the first time, please follow
[<u>this</u>](./FEGA-SOP0014_SOP_for_Federated_EGA_Helpdesk_-_How_to_obtain_Helpdesk_role_for_the_first_time.md)
SOP.

## Scope

These instructions apply to all FEGA nodes that manage roles through the
FEGA Helpdesk Portal.

## Procedure

1.  *Ensure the user requesting submitter access has registered an EGA
    account by filling in the [<u>EGA registration
    form</u>](https://ega-archive.org/register/).*

2.  *Wait for CEGA Helpdesk to validate the account. Only validated
    accounts can be granted additional roles.*

3.  *A FEGA Helpdesk admin logs in to their FEGA Helpdesk Portal
    (`helpdesk.{fega}.ega-archive.org`) and opens the **ROLES** section.*
