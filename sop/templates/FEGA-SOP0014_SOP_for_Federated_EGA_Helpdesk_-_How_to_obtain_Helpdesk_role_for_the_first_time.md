## Purpose

Being a FEGA Helpdesk member with access to the FEGA Helpdesk Portal allows you to set the submitter role so submitters can use the Submitter Portal and start depositing data, check the summary of completed FEGA submissions, and release FEGA datasets to the CEGA website for discoverability.

## Scope

Use this SOP to obtain your first-time access to your FEGA node's Helpdesk Portal.

## Procedure

1.  *Register yourself as an EGA user by populating the [<u>registration
    form</u>](https://ega-archive.org/register/).*

2.  *CEGA Helpdesk will have to verify your account. Once it has been
    verified by CEGA Helpdesk you can proceed with step 3.*

3.  *When you want to gain access to the FEGA Helpdesk Portal contact
    the CEGA Helpdesk by sending an email to
    [<u>fega-helpdesk@ega-archive.org</u>](mailto:fega-helpdesk@ega-archive.org)*

4.  *CEGA Helpdesk will verify that the request comes from an official
    FEGA partner*

5.  *Once the role has been verified the new FEGA Helpdesk member will
    receive a notification and will be able to log in to their specific
    FEGA Helpdesk Portal:*

    1.  *helpdesk.{fega}.ega-archive.org*

6.  *From here on the FEGA node has access to their Helpdesk Portal and
    can assign roles to their FEGA services (submitters and new helpdesk
    officers).*
