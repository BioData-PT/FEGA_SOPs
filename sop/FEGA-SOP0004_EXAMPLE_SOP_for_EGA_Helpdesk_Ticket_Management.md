Purpose

EGA Helpdesk provides assistance to its users by using the Request
Tracker (RT) system. Through the course of a year, EGA Helpdesk responds
to thousands of tickets across a wide variety of issues. The purpose of
this SOP is to ensure that all Helpdesk staff can manage their ticket
load in a time efficient manner. Our goal is to provide a response
within 48 working hours of each user reply and to ensure that no users’
communications are missed.

Scope

This SOP should be followed by all Helpdesk staff at all times when
taking and dealing with Helpdesk tickets and should be read in
conjunction with the SOP for [<u>EGA Helpdesk ticket
assignment</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GQLrlTlaKzrdUWeOIAmQTSYodI6oYYZ7jJCjuEZeacE/edit?usp=sharing).

Procedure

1.  Make sure you set up RT so you can instantly see tickets that are
    awaiting a reply when you log into the system.

2.  Get into good habits of answering those tickets awaiting a reply
    first thing in the morning (or as soon as you start on work
    Helpdesk).

3.  Only take tickets when you have answered all of your existing
    tickets.

4.  If you are struggling to keep on top of your tickets, **ask for
    help**.

5.  Where tickets are waiting on development work, make sure that you
    try to update the user every 48 hours and manage their expectations
    accordingly (make sure that these tickets are cross referenced
    clearly with the corresponding JIRA ticket(s)).

6.  Resolve any tickets that you believe can be resolved when it is 48
    hours since the last correspondence from the user.

7.  When you know you have a significant amount of annual leave coming
    up (i.e. one week or more), refrain from taking new tickets the week
    before (if possible) and resolve down as many of the existing ones
    as you can, letting the user know that you are going on annual leave
    and that if they need further assistance they should create a new
    ticket.

8.  The day before you go on leave make sure all of your remaining
    tickets are fully commented so other Helpdesk officers can see what
    needs to be done. In addition, tag any tickets remaining with
    “holiday priority”. By using this tag, other Helpdesk officers can
    see any of your tickets that may need addressing instantly by
    running a simple query.

9.  In exceptional cases, you may be working on a ticket that will be
    open for a long time. In this instance tag them with the “long
    running” custom tag in combination with any other appropriate tags,
    e.g. “large submission”. After each communication with the user,
    make sure reminders are updated and new dates are set so that you
    are sure to follow up with them.
