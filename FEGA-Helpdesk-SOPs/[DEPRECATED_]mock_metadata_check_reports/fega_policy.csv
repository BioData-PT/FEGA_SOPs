3. CONFIDENTIALITY

The Recipient agrees to preserve, at all times, the confidentiality of Data
pertaining to identifiable Data Subjects. In particular, the Recipient

The Recipient agrees that it, and its Registered Users, are covered by and
shall comply with the obligations contained in the General Data Protection
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (""GDPR""). In particular, the Recipient and its

to the handling of Data and the rights of Data Subjects.

Upon receipt of the Data, the Recipient will become Controller of the personal

circumstances, give access to Data to any third party, except to Registered
Users (as described below). The Recipient agrees to only give access to Data, in

access to Data, it shall first show the Registered User a copy of this Agreement
and shall inform the Registered User that he or she must comply with the
obligations contained in this Agreement and sign up to the provisions of this
Agreement in the form set out at the end of this Agreement. The Recipient agrees
that it shall only give Registered Users that are not Researchers (including but
not limited to students or new researchers to the field) access to the Data if
they are supervised by a Researcher who will take responsibility for such
Registered Users’ use of the Data. Data Provider reserves the right to request
and inspect Data security and management documentation to ensure the adequacy of
Data protection measures in countries that have no national laws comparable to
that pertaining in the European Economic Area (EEA).

Data.


7. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

transfer to the Recipient or its Registered Users any Intellectual Property
rights in or relating to the Data. The Recipient and its Registered Users shall
have the right to develop Intellectual Property based on comparisons with their
own Data.


8. CITATIONS

The Recipient agrees to acknowledge the creators and source of the Data in any
work based in whole or part on the Data. The Recipient will also declare in any
such work that those who carried out the original analysis and collection of the
Data bear no responsibility for the further analysis or interpretation of it by
the Recipient.


9. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

This Agreement will terminate immediately upon any breach of the provisions of
this Agreement by the Recipient or by the Recipient’s Registered Users. The
Recipient accepts that the changing ethical framework of human genetic research
may lead to: (i) alteration to the provisions of this Agreement, in which case
the Recipient may accept such alterations or terminate this Agreement; or (ii)
the withdrawal of this Agreement in extreme circumstances. Either party shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement with immediate effect upon giving
written notice of termination to the other party. When the Research on the Data
has been completed this Agreement will terminate.

In the event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with this Clause 9
the Recipient shall destroy all Data at the direction of Data Provider.
